# Sillynium 
Automatically generate python selenium scripts by drawing coloured boxes around webpage elements. Please see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) for how it works, vision, and what needs to be done.

TODO: VIDEO GOES HERE, WATERMARK VIDEO, ADD COMMENTS TO HTML/CSS/JS file/s, add visual diagram to roadmap for sillynium.py

## Status
***Work-in-progress:***
- Currently loads a given URL, and injects JavaScript, which allows you to draw on any given webpage. Please see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)
- Accepting contributions, created as an open-source project


## Roadmap
***Important! Please read [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)***
- Plan and vision inside
- Currently only draws grey boxes to webpages - requires further work.


## Usage
***Read the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) first***

#### sillynium.py ####
Simply run as you would any other python file
- Chromedriver will launch Chrome + URL
- You can now draw rectangles to that webpage - does nothing more yet! Please see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)

#### concept/poc.py ####
[poc.py](concept/poc.py) is a proof of concept only and will not be developed further. 
- It may fail on your OS as it was only coded to handle Windows 10 and Chrome
- Run it, but please also read the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)
- For instructions, see [poc_instructions](concept/poc_instructions.md)

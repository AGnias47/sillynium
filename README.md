# Sillynium 
Automatically generate python selenium scripts by drawing coloured boxes around webpage elements. Please see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) for how it works and what still needs to be done.


## Status
***Work-in-progress:***
- Currently loads a given URL, and injects JavaScript, which allows you to draw on any given webpage. Please see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)

***Contributing:***
- Accepting contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)


## Roadmap
***Important! Please read the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)***
Plan very clearly laid out there. Currently only draws grey boxes to webpages, requires further work.


## Usage
***Read the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) first***

### sillynium.py ###
Simply run as you would any other python file
- Chromedriver will launch Chrome + URL
- You can now draw rectangles to that webpage - does nothing more yet! Please see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)

### concept/poc.py ###
**NOTE:** [poc.py](concept/poc.py) is a ***proof of concept only*** and will not be developed further. 
- It may **fail on your OS as it was only coded to handle Windows 10 and Chrome**
- Run it to play around, but please also read the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)
- For instructions, see [poc_instructions](concept/poc_instructions.md)
